      <h1 id="str">Unparalleled Strength</h1>
      <p>
        Saitama ossessesseemingly limitless physical strength and is capable of
        effortlessly defeating powerful monsters and villains with a single,
        nonchalant punch (although this strength is not limited to punches).
        Saitama's punch is so powerful that many enemies simply explode when
        struck. He is also shown to be able to effortlessly destroy walls and
        buildings. An example of this casual, yet overwhelming offensive power
        occurs when Saitama launches himself from the top of a building, blasts
        right through a giant meteor with a punch, lands safely, and just calmly
        decides to go home.[43] Another instance is when Sonic tries to slice
        Saitama's head in half with a sword, but Saitama stops the sword by
        catching it with his teeth, effortlessly shattering the blade with the
        power of his jaw.[44] When launched from Earth to the moon by a strike
        from Boros, he used his jumping power to return to Earth in mere
        moments, causing a huge shock wave and immense tremors on the surface of
        the moon upon departure, as well as on Boros's ship upon landing.[45] A
        "normal" punch from him was shown to be very fatal, even to someone as
        durable as Boros.[46] A single "serious" punch from him was able to
        counter Boros's strongest attack, Collapsing Star Roaring Cannon, an
        attack capable of wiping out the entire Earth's surface, Saitama
        completely negated the attack using his serious punch, the shockwave
        from the punch was also powerful enough to part clouds on a global
        scale.[47] Saitama is capable of destroying the Earth if he wanted
        to.[48] His strength has been said by numerous characters to defy
        reason.

      <h1 id="leap">Enhanced Leap</h1>
      <p>
        Saitama's inability to fly is somewhat compensated by his immense leg
        strength, allowing him to leap tremendous heights and distances at high
        speeds. This can be seen when Saitama smashed his head through the
        ceiling of a gymnasium during the hero tryouts simply by jumping. He was
        also able to smash a building into its foundation just by leaping off
        from its roof.His greatest feat in this regard, however, was when he
        leaped from the surface of the moon and ended up back on Earth at a
        specified point, leaving a crater on the moon's surface in the process.
        He is also able to jump while still in the air, adjusting his angle of
        ascent or descent thanks to his amazing power.

      <h1 id="speed">Unparalleled Speed and Reflexes</h1>
      <p>
        Saitama was able to complete a 1500 meter dash in an instant during his
        hero tryouts.[58] He has proven able to effortlessly keep up with
        Speed-o'-Sound Sonic, who can move at above hypersonic speeds.[59] Even
        Genos's computerized targeting systems have difficulty tracking him.[60]
        Saitama once bit Sonic's sword at such great speed, Sonic didn't even
        know what happened.[61] Saitama has also shown the ability to run down a
        building to save a piece of salmon he was having for lunch, and leap
        back up said building without bystanders noticing he had even done
        so.[62] His speed is so impressive that he can even outpace the likes of
        Flashy Flash, easily dodging his sword swings.[63] When kicked to the
        moon by Boros's attack, Saitama returned to Earth in mere seconds which
        shows that Saitama can even travel at sub-relativistic speeds. Saitama
        also easily blocked Geryuganshoop's near lightspeed rocks, the speed of
        which being like a bad joke to him.[64] Ironically, despite his
        incredible reflexes and speed, he still has problems squashing a simple
        mosquito.
